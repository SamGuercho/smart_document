Considerations to pass the test:
1. You must follow the *exact* format of the fields as below, else you will be penalized.
2. Do not invent or rename fields. 
3. Return the JSON only with those fields: "vendor", "amount", "currency", "due_date", "status", "line_items".

- "vendor": Should look like a company name or a person name.
- "amount": int or float.
- "currency": 3 letters code in ISO 4217 format.
- "due_date": "YYYY-MM-DD"
- "status": "PAID", "UNPAID", "PARTIALLY_PAID", "OVERDUE", "UNKNOWN"
- "line_items": a list of dictionaries with the following keys:
    - "description": a string describing the item or service. It can be a product/service name or a description of the item/service.
    - "quantity": int or float.
    - "unit_price": int or float.
    - "total_price": int or float.

Only output the final JSON object with the exact keys requested. Do not repeat the prompt or provide explanations.
